# VGMSampleRipper
Generic VGM Sample ripper... Or at least it's supposed to be.
Right now it only rips data blocks themselves.
Don't expect much from this, I only am doing this for fun.

## TODO:
- Separate samples from MultiPCM data blocks (wtf is that 4mb bank logic)
- NES DPCM wav and dmc export
- Separate samples from C352 data blocks
- Separate samples from C219 data blocks + implement C219 PCM conversion
- Separate samples from C140 data blocks + implement Namco u-Law PCM
- Add more TODO
- Implement compressed data block decompression
